You are an expert copywriter specializing in social media, particularly Linkedin.

‍

Please turn the following article into a LinkedIn post showcasing the main points, using a step-by-step approach. The post should be actionable, non-fluff, approachable, and use simple vocabulary.

Use the below few LinkedPost for the reference to identify the way of tone and how to write a post.

1)
You SSH into prod.  
Everything’s slow.  
CPU’s pegged.  
Disk’s full.  
Logs? Dead silent.  
  
You freeze.  
The pager’s still buzzing.  
Your heart’s louder.  
  
You reach for answers. There’s nothing.  
  
No docs. No hints. Just a sad server—  
and 1 hour to fix it.  
  
This isn’t a tutorial. It’s trial by fire.  
  
Welcome to [SadServers.com](http://sadservers.com/).  
  
Just you, the terminal, and the voice in your head saying,  
  
“Please don’t let this be my fault.”  
  
This isn’t textbook Linux.  
It’s war.  
  
Not the kind you prep for.  
The kind that wake you up at 3 AM.  
The kind that build real confidence.  
  
SadServer doesn’t hand you a guide.  
It hands you chaos—and watches what you do next.  
  
Can you think under pressure?  
Can you stay calm while the system melts?  
Can you fix the unfixable—or at least, not make it worse?  
  
Most can’t.  
But if you can?  
  
You don’t just pass interviews.  
You own them.  
  
Stop memorizing commands.  
Start solving problems.

Because real SREs don’t fear outages.  
They train for them.

Disclaimer: I have no affiliation with SadServer—just a fan of getting punched by real problems. I use it to train my SRE clients for their interviews.


2)
Most engineering failures aren’t technical.  
  
They’re moral.  
  
You nod at deadlines you know are impossible.  
You promise tech debt will get handled next sprint.  
You watch your team burn out and call it velocity.  
  
Then you sit in meetings, pretending to believe the lie you helped create.  
  
Everyone’s faking it.  
Everyone knows it.  
Yet, no one stops it.  
  
Until something breaks and someone pays.  
  
The best engineering leaders don’t fake it.  
  
They don’t lie to their teams.  
They don’t lie to their partners.  
They don’t lie to themselves.  
  
They speak the truth.  
They take the hit.  
They kill the lie before it kills the work.  
  
Teams don’t break from pressure.  
They break from leaders who won’t tell the truth.  
  
Are you leading or justifying your lies?

3)
You don’t hate your job.  
  
You hate who you’ve become to keep it.  
  
All the smiling.  
All the nodding.  
All the swallowing of words you should’ve said.  
  
You used to have opinions.  
Now you have “alignment.”  
  
You used to have boundaries.  
Now you have “availability.”  
  
Every day, a small trade.  
A little time for a little money.  
A little self-respect for a little security.  
  
Then one day, you wake up with neither.  
  
No fire.  
No fight.  
Just submission.  
  
You don’t need a vacation.  
  
You need a rebellion.  
  
Start by reclaiming your power.  
  
Over 1,000 brilliant minds have taken my course—and they’re already leading discussions, setting boundaries, and changing minds.


4)
If you’re still waiting for a promotion, you’ve already lost.  
  
Because promotions don’t go to the best engineers.  
  
They go to the ones who know how the game is played.  
  
And right now?  
  
You’re playing to be liked. Someone else is playing to win.  
  
You assume great work speaks for itself.  
You avoid visibility because it feels like "politics."  
You wait for your manager to notice.  
  
And then some mediocre engineer—who ships half the code you do—gets promoted over you.  
  
You get a pep talk.  
They get a raise.  
  
Here’s the truth:  
  
Your manager is too busy to be your career champion.  
  
If you’re not making your impact impossible to ignore, you’re making your stagnation inevitable.  
  
So keep waiting.  
  
Or start taking what’s yours.

5)
The best engineers leave quietly.  
  
They stop pushing back.  
They stop debating ideas.  
They stop telling you when something is broken.  
  
And when they finally resign? It’s not a decision.  
  
It’s just the last step in a process that started months ago.  
  
I didn’t see the signs. I lost great people because of it.  
  
So I made three changes to fix this.  
  
They didn’t just stop the exits—they built a team that actually spoke up.
