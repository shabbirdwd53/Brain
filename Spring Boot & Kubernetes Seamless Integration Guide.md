I always thought deploying Spring Boot apps to Kubernetes would be complex.  
But once I tried it step-by-step, things just _clicked_.

Hereâ€™s how you can get your Spring Boot app running on Kubernetes â€” without feeling lost.

ðŸ‘‡ Step-by-step breakdown ðŸ‘‡



1. Start with Docker  
Package your Spring Boot app using a simple `Dockerfile`.  
It looks like this:


FROM openjdk:17   
ADD target/app.jar app.jar   
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]


Build the image and youâ€™re ready to ship.



2. Push it to a registry  
Once your image is built, push it to Docker Hub or your company registry:


docker push yourname/app



3. Create your Kubernetes Deployment
Define a simple `deployment.yaml` that points to your Docker image.  
Set the number of replicas and resource limits.  
This tells Kubernetes _how_ to run your app.



4. Expose your app  
Use a Kubernetes `Service` to expose your app.  
Go with `NodePort` for quick access or `Ingress` for production-grade routing.



5. Add health checks  
Kubernetes needs to know your app is alive.  
Use `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`.  
This helps avoid downtime when your app is slow or unresponsive.



6. Move configs out of your code  
Use `ConfigMaps` for app settings and `Secrets` for sensitive stuff like DB passwords.  
No more hardcoded values â€” cleaner and safer.



7. Add autoscaling  
Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to automatically scale your app based on load.  
Set CPU/memory thresholds and let Kubernetes do the rest.



Thatâ€™s it.  
Spring Boot + Kubernetes doesnâ€™t have to be scary.

Build â†’ Containerize â†’ Deploy â†’ Scale  
And youâ€™re production-ready.

If you havenâ€™t tried it yet â€” this is your sign.  
Itâ€™s simpler than it sounds, and once you get the hang of it, thereâ€™s no going back.
