Listing all the Problems and challenges solved and faced.

## **Building Consent management System**

 - Managing execution and engineering
 - Small application to be converted to platform in short period of time to solve major problems
 - Challenging Issue was the partition key for storing the data by different system.
	 - Changing of partition key causes an Compliance Issue where different consent was shown for different user

## Building RxPD System

- All the learning of PetRx was crucial in building RxPD
- It was 10x the size of PetRx, However the learning from PetRx helped us a lot to have smoother planning and execution
	- Team Collaboration (All teams to agree upon the same architecture and plan)
	- Timelines (It can overlap with teams for dependency)

## Building PetRx

- Collaborate effectively with different teams
- More than 100 team collaborated for the project, However I had to work with 22 teams
- Created a foundation for different project like RxPD

## Building Automation Suite

- Different team using different approach and libraries for Automation
- No Standardised way of Automation
- No Common Automation across platform

## Setting Up LAB Environments

- Earlier, engineers worked with UAT partners in EST and PST time for all the testing flows.
- Not sustainable for very long.
- Complex and legacy system

- Proposed a plan for Lab setup.
- talked to different team members regarding their challenges for UAT
- presented the plan, advantages and time saving for setting up LAB env to Director of Engineering keeping Manager in confidence
- One time Cost and logistics and technical setup was a challenge

- Worked with all the stack holders to setup Env.
- Result in smoother and better Testing flows. All team member utilising not just for testing, for debugging and understating complex scenarios as well

## Legacy System Testing

- Biggest technical challenge
- Converting Windows services to REST API's for Automation Flows fir Legacy testing

- We created intermediately Application, which exposes REST APi for the equivalent Windows Services.
- Then those new application was implemented in the Automation framework for complete legacy automation (2200 API's)

## eFax Implementation

- It was black box when implementing in H&W
- An Old system for communication as federal requirement
- to get work around and automate the system, cannot be done with just faxes

- Used eFax system and automated Mail box flows with QR code detection

## RxPD Observability

- Connected with more than. 200 teams for integration to build observalibity
- Most time crunch system as need to integrate with many systems.

- had to have challenging discussions with Product and business as this was not a direct impact system as per them as we were already building RxPD.
- Later when it was build despite challenges, and it was used to identify system flows and identifying bugs faster than components team, in the War rooms, its true potential was evolved.
## Dexter for Test Generation using GenAI

- Test Generation for Legacy System
- Test Generation for System having no appropriate tests
