I just spent time reading Netflix's approach to rebuilding their video processing pipeline,

It is a great example of how to modernize a large, complex system.



Background:

- Netflix launched their first video pipeline in 2007.
- Over 15+ years, they upgraded it to support SD, 4K HDR, per-title optimizations, and more.
- But by 2014, their ‚ÄúReloaded‚Äù platform started facing problems:
- Code was tightly connected, making it hard to change video quality without re-encoding everything.
- The system was monolithic, creating hidden dependencies.
- Release cycles were slow (2-4 weeks).
- New features were harder and slower to build.



What they did (starting 2018):  
Netflix decided to rebuild their Next Generation Platform, "Cosmos."
Cosmos aimed to significantly increase system flexibility and feature development velocity. To achieve this, Cosmos was developed as a computing platform for workflow-driven, media-centric microservices.


They carefully separated different parts of the pipeline into individual services:



Core Microservices:

- Video Inspection Service (extracts metadata [mezzanine])
- Complexity Analysis Service (analyzes how complex the video is)
- Ladder Generation Service (creates optimized bitrate ladders)
- Video Encoding Service (handles actual encoding)
- Video Validation Service (checks if encoded video meets expectations)
- Video Quality Service (calculates quality scores)



They also built different orchestrators to handle streaming and studio operations separately.



Impact:

- They ran both the old and new systems side by side until September 2023.
- They adapted quickly when Netflix launched its ad-supported plan in 2022.
- The new system made it much faster and easier for developers to build new features.



Takeaway:  
Defining the right service boundaries can completely change how flexible and scalable a system becomes.


Question for you:  
Have you ever had to break apart a monolithic system?  
How did you decide where to split the services?
