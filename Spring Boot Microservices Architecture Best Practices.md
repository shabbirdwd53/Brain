I used to think building microservices with Spring Boot was just about splitting a big app into smaller ones.  
But over time, I realized it’s not that simple.

Here are 8 best practices I learned the hard way while building Spring Boot microservices:



**1. Keep services focused**  
Each service should solve one business problem.  
For example, don’t mix “user management” and “payment” in the same service. Keep them separate.



**2. Secure every service**  
Don’t assume internal services are safe.  
Use OAuth2 and JWT to secure your APIs.  
Make sure only the right users can access the right resources.



**3. Use Spring Cloud for the basics**  
You don’t need to build everything from scratch.  
Use Spring Cloud for things like:

- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- Central Config (Spring Cloud Config)
- API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)
- Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j)

These tools solve common problems and save time.



**4. Externalize configuration**  
Never hardcode URLs, credentials, or settings.  
Use `application.yml` or Config Server.  
Switch configs based on environment: dev, test, prod.



**5. Make your system observable**  
When something breaks, you need to know why.  
Add:

- Logs (use structured logging)
- Metrics (with Micrometer + Prometheus)
- Tracing (with Sleuth + Zipkin)

This makes debugging 10x easier.



**6. Prefer async communication**  
Calling one service from another using REST can fail if the other service is down.  
Try using messaging tools like Kafka or RabbitMQ.  
It helps make your system more reliable.



**7. Test everything, not just units**  
Microservices need more than just unit tests.  
Use:

- Contract tests (Spring Cloud Contract)
- Integration tests (Testcontainers)
- Mock services for external APIs

This helps you catch real issues early.



**8. Automate your CI/CD**  
Manually deploying is risky.  
Use tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI to:

- Build your app
- Run tests
- Deploy to production

Automate this so you can release often and safely.



If you're building microservices with Spring Boot, start with these 8 steps.  
They seem simple, but they make a big difference as your system grows.
