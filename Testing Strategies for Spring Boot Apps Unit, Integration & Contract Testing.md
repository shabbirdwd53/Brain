I always thought my Spring Boot apps were well-tested.  
Until one day… they broke in production.

That’s when I realized — I wasn’t testing the right _things_ the right _way_.

Here’s what I learned 👇



📍 Testing Spring Boot apps isn’t just about writing @Test. 
You need a strategy.  
A _3-layered approach_ that covers different levels of your application:



1. Unit Tests — Stay small & fast  
Just test a single class. No Spring context. No real dependencies.  
Use:


- `@WebMvcTest` for controllers
- `@MockBean` or Mockito to fake the rest


💡 This is where you ask: “_Does this method do the right thing with the right input?_”



2. Integration Tests — Test the wiring  
Boot up the Spring context. Let the real beans talk.  
No mocks. Use real DBs like Postgres or H2.  
Use:

- @SpringBootTest
- Real TestRestTemplate or `MockMvc`


💡 Ask: “_Do these parts work well together like they would in production?_”



3. Contract Tests — Test the handshake  
If your service talks to others, you must test the contract.  
Are you sending what the consumer expects?  
Are you consuming what the provider sends?


Use:
- Spring Cloud Contract
- Consumer-driven contracts


💡 Ask: “_If the other service changes, will my app break?_”



What changed after this?  
I stopped guessing and started _trusting_ my tests.  
No more "It works on my machine" moments.

If you're building with Spring Boot, this is the testing playbook I wish I had earlier.
