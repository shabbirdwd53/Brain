I used to think choosing between **monoliths and microservices** was easy.  
You just go with microservices, right?

Not quite.

So I did what any curious engineer would do—  
I built both.



🚀 Started with a **monolith** for a side project:

- One codebase
- One deploy
- Super fast to ship features

Everything felt in control... until it didn’t.

One day, a small bug in a logging module brought the whole app down.  
And every deploy felt like walking a tightrope.  
That’s when I decided to **break things apart**.



🔁 Enter **microservices**:

- Broke the app into smaller services
- Gave each team their own deploy pipeline
- Used different databases for different needs

Felt great at first—until we hit real-world issues:

- Spent hours debugging across services
- Managing infra exploded overnight
- One service would fail silently and bring chaos downstream



Here’s what I wish someone had told me earlier 👇

🧠 **Monoliths are not bad.**  
They’re fast, simple, and great when:

- You’re moving fast
- Your team is small
- You don’t want to spend time managing infra

🧠 **Microservices are powerful, but costly.**  
Use them when:

- Teams are getting blocked on each other
- You need to scale parts independently
- You’re okay with investing in tooling and observability



💡 Takeaway?

Don’t start with what Google or Netflix does.  
Start with what helps **you ship faster**.

Then evolve.

Most scalable systems **didn’t start scalable**—they grew into it.



If you're curious, I’m happy to share how we broke our monolith in phases — without losing our minds.  
Let me know. Might turn that into a full write-up.
