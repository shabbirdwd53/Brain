You think leader election is easy.

Just pick a server, right?  
Then a network failure happens.

The leader disappears.  
Two new servers claim leadership.  
Now you have chaos instead of consensus.

This is why Paxos exists.

Here’s how it **actually** works:


Step 1: The Problem
In distributed systems, you need **one** leader.
But nodes crash, networks split, and failures happen.
How do we elect a leader that **everyone** agrees on—without confusion?


Step 2: Why Simple Voting Fails
If two nodes get votes at the same time, who wins?
If the leader crashes, how do we pick a new one **without** breaking the system?
 
 
 Step 3: Enter Paxos – The Two-Phase Election

📌 Phase 1: Prepare (Propose a Leader)
A node (proposer) says, _“Can I be the leader?”_
Acceptors respond:
    
    - If they haven't committed to another leader, they agree.
    - If they already accepted someone, they return that info.


📌 Phase 2: Accept (Confirm the Leader)
If the proposer gets a **majority (quorum)** to agree, it declares itself the leader.
Now, everyone follows this leader until failure happens.

 
Step 4: What Happens on Failure?
If the leader crashes, a **new election starts** using the same process.
Since a **quorum always overlaps**, nodes never get split-brain.


Paxos ensures that:  
✅ There’s **only one leader at a time**  
✅ The system **never contradicts itself**  
✅ Even if failures happen, **a new leader emerges without confusion**

This isn’t just theory. Google’s Chubby, Zookeeper use similar ideas.
